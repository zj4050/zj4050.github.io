                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Supermassive Binary Black Holes (SMBBHs) are formed by the mergers of galaxies. Through studying them, we can gain more information about how galaxies form and evolve through the cosmic time</p>

                <p>While they are important for us to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies, we cannot distinguish them from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) that are powered by single black holes. The reason we cannot distinguish is they are unresolved by our telescopes.</p>

                <p>But, even though it is unresolved by our telescopes, we still want to identify them. Fortunately, with the current development of technology, we are able to detect the electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by those SMBBHs. There are studies that are carried around to study the behaviors of EM signals of SMBBHs. We try to identify these binary black holes by studying the surrouding environments of these SMBBHs.</p>

                <!-- <p>But what distinctive features we can find based on the various SEDs emitted by SMBBHs? It's the <b>ionization effects</b> of the surrouding clouds that can be detected by our telescopes.</p> -->
                <br>
                
                <h3>Main Idea</h3>
                <p>The main idea is this: because the shape of SED is varying through time, then the ionization structure of the nearby clouds will differ from that near the conventional AGN powered by single black holes. If we are able to identify the difference in the ionization structures, it will be possible for us to pick out SMBBHs among those unresolved AGNs</p>
